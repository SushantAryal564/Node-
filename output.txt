This is what we know about the node.js: 1. Reading and Writing Files
  const fs = require('fs')
  readFileSync("Filename",'utf-8')
  fs.writeFileSync("Filename",text)

2. Blocking and Non Blocking Asynchronous Nature of Node
  Synchronous: 
  It means each statement is processed one after another line by line. It is also called blocking code as certain action can be done after the previous action has been finished.
  Asynchronous: 
  we offload the heavy work to be done in background. Then when the work is done a callback function that we register is called to handle the result. Rest of the code is executing
  The Asynchronous Nature of Node.js: 
  Node.js is single threaded so in each application there is only one thread. if all the user are accessing the same thread there will be a problem. so when Asynchronous code is used which instead of blocking it does the task in background and callback function is called when the task is completed. Node.js is build around callback function. Callbacks doesn't make asynchronous it work in some of the module in node.js only. 
  callback hell

3. Creating a simple Web server
  Node js is built around callback in order to implement an asynchronous behaviours. we need 'http' module to build http server. To create a server we need to create a server and start a server. http.createserver takes the callback function which is called every time when request is received.
