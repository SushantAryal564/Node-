1. Reading and Writing Files
  const fs = require('fs')
  readFileSync("Filename",'utf-8')
  fs.writeFileSync("Filename",text)

2. Blocking and Non Blocking Asynchronous Nature of Node
  Synchronous: 
  It means each statement is processed one after another line by line. It is also called blocking code as certain action can be done after the previous action has been finished.
  Asynchronous: 
  we offload the heavy work to be done in background. Then when the work is done a callback function that we register is called to handle the result. Rest of the code is executing
  The Asynchronous Nature of Node.js: 
  Node.js is single threaded so in each application there is only one thread. if all the user are accessing the same thread there will be a problem. so when Asynchronous code is used which instead of blocking it does the task in background and callback function is called when the task is completed. Node.js is build around callback function. Callbacks doesn't make asynchronous it work in some of the module in node.js only. 
  callback hell

3. Creating a simple Web server
  Node js is built around callback in order to implement an asynchronous behaviours. we need 'http' module to build http server. To create a server we need to create a server and start a server. http.createserver takes the callback function which is called every time when request is received. 

4. Routing
  Routing means implementing different actions for different urls. 
  When we are using the browser the browser is automatically perform a request for website favicon. we ignore it.
  Header=> http header is the piece of information about the response. header and status quote shoudl be always above the response. 

5. Building a very simple API
  . represent the directory from where we run in terminal. All node.js project get access to the variable __dirname which always translate to teh directory in which the script that is executing is located. 

6. HTML Templating Building the templates
  Each different file will trigger a different request so we have to handle each assest request from the end user. 

13. Parsing Variables from urls
  With url.parse we get the object with different key and value amoung them pathname and query is the one which we need. 

14. Using Modules 2 our own Module
  We can create our own module and export something from them and import the function in another module and use the function. 
  In node.js every single file is treated as module.
  In each module we have access to module and on it we can set export property.
  While importing import the cutom module only after core module.
16. Types of Packages and install
  There are two type of packages:
  Simple dependencies
    Simple dependencies are the packages that contain code that will include in out own code, code upon which we built our own application. 
  developement dependencies
    These are the tools for development, for example code bundler like webpack, debugger tool. 
    nodemon helps develope node js application automatically restarting node appliation whenever we change some files. nodemon it doesn't work with git bash.

  There are two type of install:
  local install

  global install
    a package should be installed globally when it provides an executable command that we can run from command line interface. They are generally developement dependencies.

18. Package Versioning and updating
  Most packages follow semantic version notation. 
  Version number is always expressed with three number. First number is major version , second minor version and third version is called patch version. Patch version is intened to fix bugs.
  minor version means new feature has been included in the packages but it doesn't include breaking change.
  major version is huge new version.
  ^ means we expect patch and minor releases.
  ~ means update the patch
  * means update to latest update

Introduction to Back end Web development
1. An overview of How the Web Workds
  request response model or client server architecture
  domain name isn't a real address of the server we are trying to access so we need to convert the domain name to the real address of the server which happen through DNS. DNS stand for domain name server which are the special server basically phonebook of internet. 
  When we open up a website the browser at first make a request to a DNS and this server matched web address to the server real IP address. This happen through ISP. which is sent back to the browser a real address.(https//216.58.211.206:443)(protocal/ IP address / portNumber). port number is to identify the specific service running in a server like subaddress. 

  When we have the real address a TCP/IP socket connection is established between browser and server. This connection is kept alive till the file of the website is transfered. We make the http request a communication protacal (a system of rules that allow two or more service to communicate). A request message look like:

  GET/ maps HTTP/1.1 (http Method/ request target/ HTTP version)
  HTTP request header(many different possibilities)
  Request Body (only when sending data to server. eg: post)

  Different methods are:
  GET,
  POST, 
  PUT and patch

  A HTTP response message look like:

  HTTP/1.1 200 OK (start line: HTTP version+status code+status message)
  HTTP response header (many different possibilites): It is backend developer who specifies it and sends them on response.
  response body (most response): it is a backend developer who specifies and send them back in response.It generally contain html or json data. 

  If we are trying to access the website there will be many many request and responses. At first only the html file is received after which the file is scanned to get all the assest that it need to build the entire website. For each of the file browser will make a new HTTP request to the server this back and froth happen for every files. When all the files are recevied then the website is rendered in the website.  

2.HTTP in action
  200 means ok response. 

4.Front End vs Back end web development
  Front end is about everthing about what happen in browser. Technology are html, css and javascript, React, Angular etc. Frontend stack 

  Backend is about eveything that happen in the web server. Server is the computer that is connect to the internet that stores the basic files like HTML, CSS and images and second runs the http server. Static and dynamic server. we can code for IFT devices with the help of node. 

5. Static vs Dynamic vs API

  static website is when the developer uploads the final ready to serve file to webserver. this file are sent to the browser upon request. There is no work done in the server, there is no application running.

  Dynamic website are  built on the server each times reqeust comes in. It contains database and application running which fetch data from database and built page on template the user request based on the data coming from the database. This whole process is called server side rendering. dynamic website or web applicatioin are kind of same.
  It is also called Server side render 

  API
  Application programming interface a piece of software that can be used by another piece of software that allow one software to talk to another. 
  with the api we only send the data to the browser usually in json format not the entire website ready to be displayed.
  Two part:
  Building API
  Consuming API on client side where website is assemble by plugging the data that we receive into some sort of template like framework like React, Angular etc.  so with API approach the building phase of website is moved from the backend to the frontend. It is also called client side render. Node is perfect tool for building the API. 
  API can be consumed by other client rather than only browser. we can use it for native mobile app, native app, native window app.

How Node.js works A look Behind the Scence
2. Node, V8, Libuv and C++
  Node is a program that is written with C++ and javascript.
  Node.js architecture in term of node dependencies node runtime has several dependencies which are:
    1. V8
      v8 engine convert the javascript code to machine code that computer can understand.
    2. Libuv
      it is open source library with strong focus on asynchronous I/O. It give node.js access to underlying computer operating system, file system, networking and more. It implements two important feature of node.js:
        1. Event loop
          It is responsible for handling easy task like executing call backs and network IO.
        2. Thread Pool
          It is for heavy task. It is written in C++. 
  This architecture allow us to write 100% pure javascript code running in node.js and still access to function like file reading which is actually implemented in libuv.
  Other dependencies it depends on are http-parser, c-ares, openSSL and zlib. 
  
3. Process, Threads and the Thread Pool
  When we run node in the computer it means there is a node process running in the computer. Node.js runs in the single thread no matter if we have the single user or ten million user, so we need to be careful of not blocking the thread. when the program is initialized top level code is executed after which event loop is executed. some task are heavy expensive to be executed in event loop because they will block single thread. In this case thread pool comes into action it give 4 or more thread. so event loop automatically offload the heavy task to the thread pool automatically behind the scence. The task that are offloaded are generally File system, cryptography, compresion and DNS lookups etc. 

4. The Node.js Event loop
  Event loop is where application code that is inside callback function is executed. Node.js is build around callback functions. It work this way because node uses event driven architecture. all the action like http request release the event as soon as they are done with their work, event loop will pick up this event and call the callback functions that are associated with each event. event loop receive event each time something important happen and will then call the necessary callback. 
  Event loop does the orchestration which means that it receive events, call their callback function and offload the more expensive task to the thread pools. 
  as soon as we run the node application event loop start running right way, it has multiple phases and each phase has a callback queue, which are the callback comming from event that the event loop receive. Four important phases of event loop are:
    1. first phase take care of callback of expired timers if there are callback function from setTimeout() that just expired these are the first ones to be processed by event loop. 
    2. I/O polling and execution of I/O callback 
    3. setImmediate callback: A special kind of timer that we can use if we want to process callback immediately after I/0 polling and execution phase.
    4. close Callback: All close event are processed.
  
  Dont' Block event loop:
    Don't use sync version of function in fs, crypto and zlib modules in your callback function.
    Don't perform complex calculation in event loop.
    Be careful with JSON in large object.
    Dont' use too complex regular expression.

5. The Event Loop in Practise
  Top level code get executed immediately. 
  Event loop waits for stuff to happen in the poll phase. 

6. Event and Event driven architecture
  Most of the node module are build around event driven architecture. In node there are certain object called event emitter that emit named event. This event can be listened by the eventlistener that we set up which will fire off callback function that are attached to each listener. This is called observer pattern. 


7. Event in practice
  .on in a node project then we are listening,for an event. 

8. Streams
  Stream are used to process data piece by piece without completing the whole read or write operation, and therefore without keeping all the data in memory.
  Streams are instance of the EventEmitter class. All stream can emit and listen to named events. 
  Streams are prefect for handling large volume of data for example videos. 
  More efficient data processing in term of memory (no need to keep all data in memory) and time (we don't have to wait until all the data is available).
  Four type of stream in nodes are:
    1. Readable Streams
      Stream from which we can read (consume) data. 
      Example: http request, fs read Streams.
      Important Event: data(emited when new piece of data is to consume), end
      Function on Stream: pipe() and read()
    
    2. Writable Streams
      Stream to which we can write data
      example: http response, fs write Streams
      important event: drain finish
      function: write() and end()

    3. Duplex Streams
      Streams that are both readable and writeable. 
      example: net web socket
    
    4. Transform streams:
      Duplex streams that transform data as it is written or read.
      Example: zlib Gzip creation

9. Stream in Practise
  Normal way of reading the file using the readFile require node to load the entire file into memory and then only it can send the data.

  Stream:
  Instead of reading the file into a variable, and having to store that variable into memory, we could make a readable stream and as we receive each chunk of data, we send it to client as response which is the writable stream. Each time there is a new piece of data that we can consume, a readable stream emits the data event. we can listen to that. 
  response is the writable string so we can use write method to send every single piece of data into that stream. 
  our readable stream so the one we're using to read the file from the disk is much faster than sending the result witht] the response writable stream over the network. This will overwhel the response stream which cannot handle all this incoming data so fast. This problem is called backpressure.
  Backpressure happen when the response cannot send the data nearly as fast as it is receiving it from the file. 
  so, we need to use the pipe operator which is available on all readable stream and it allow us to pipe the output of readable stream  right into the input of the writable stream.

10. How Requiring modules really works
  In node.js each javascript file is treated as a seperate module. 
  Node.js used the commonJs moduel system. require(), exports or moudule.exports
  ES module system in used in browser. import/export
  What happen when we require() a module
  resolving and loading ==> wrapping ==> Execution ==>Returning exports ==> caching

11. How Requiring Modules really works
  require function returns exports of the required module.
  module.exports is the returned object.
  use module.exports to export one single variable eg one class or one fuunction
  use exports to export multiple named variable 
12. Requring Modules in practice
  console.log(arguments)
  arguments is an array in javascript which contain all the values that were passed into a function.

Express Let's Start building the Natours API

1. what is Express
  Express is a minimal node.js framework, a higher level of abstraction. It is build on top of node.js. Express contains a very robust set of feature,complex routing, easier handling of request and response, middleware, server-side rendering.
  Express allows for rapid development of node.js application.
  Express makes it easier to orgainze our application into the MVC architecture.
