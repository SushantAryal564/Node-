3. What is Mongoose?
   Mongoose is an object Data Modeling library for mongodb and node.js a higher level of abstraction. Express is an layer of abstraction over node.js whereas mongoose is an layer of abstraction over mongodb.
   object Data Modeling library is a way for us to write javascript code that will then interact with database.
   Mongooose give us lot more functionality out of the box allow for rapid and simple develoddpment of mongoDB databse interactions.
   Features: Schemas to model data and relationship, easy data validation, simple query API, middleware etc.
   Mongoose schema: Where we model our data, by describing the structure of the data, default values and validation.
   Mongoose Model: a wrapper for the schema, providing an interface to the database for CRUD operations.

4. Creating a simple Tour Model
   MOngoose is all about model which is like a blueprint we use to create documents. It is like a classes in the javascript from which we create object out of them.
   We create a model in mongoose in order to create document using it, and also to query update and delete these documents. To perform each of the CRUD operation we need a MONGOOSE model. We create a model from the mongoose schema.
   creating a new Schema in mongoose:
   const tourSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
   name:String,
   rating:Number,
   price:Number,
   })
